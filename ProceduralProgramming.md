# Procedural programming
* Does the language support procedural programming?

  - Java can be considered as containing procedural programming ideas, and by creating a static mehod that only uses local variables and paramaters could be considered procedural. However, this all depends on how you look at procedural programming as a whole, and is to this day still a debated topic. Generally Java can support it, but definitly not in all aspects.
  
  - C# much like Java can be forced into "supporting" procedural programming, but as a whole it does not. The very basics of an OO language such as inheritence go against what it means to be procedural and thusly C# is not really a procedural language.
