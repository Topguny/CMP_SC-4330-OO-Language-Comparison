# Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types

- Java supports lambda's in full since Java 8, but doesn't have true functional closures which can complicate their use. Functions do not exist within Java as their own type. However you can use functional interfaces to get a result similar to having functions as their own type.

- C# has over time changed to include many functional programing features such as lambdas, full closures, and most recently functions as a type in the form of local functions. Local functions are somewhat lmited in scope as they can only be private and used by others withing their holding class, but they are very close to stand alone functions as a type.
