# Unique features of the language
* Does the language have any particularly unique features?
  - Java
    * Extremely easy to learn, that is the reason it is the first language that most people learn. Many high schools and middle school teach it even.
    * Java is platform-independent, making it extremely easy to move from one system to another. That is why it is so popular for web applications. Java is platform-independent at both the source and binary levels.
    * An object oriented language.
    * Very scure, do the fact that it never uses explicit pointers, as well as its bytecode verifier.
  - C#
    * Is highly portabel much like Java, but in a different way, C# is the language that most reflects CLI (Common Language Infrastructure. A C# compiler could theoretically generate machine code like traditional compilers of C++ or Fortran.
    * LINQ (language integrated query) is part of the .NET framework which C# can utilize. Making it easier to convert XML, or look at documents, or make database calls.
    * Functional programming, C# 3.0 added more to this with lightweight syntax for lambda expressions, extension methods.
