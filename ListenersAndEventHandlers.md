# Implementation of listeners and event handlers

  - Java uses the ActionListener interface to most commonly handle events. Any class the implements ActionListener can create objects, that can then call the addActionListener method that will preform a method when the listener detects an action being preformed. Listners have a complex and varied set of uses within Java, and can be setup to do a large number of different tasks.
  
  - C# handles events through a delegate model, where a subscriber is registered with a provider and recieves notifications from the provider. An event is simply a message that is sent, to signal that an action has occured. Event classes can be set up to record different information when that specific event occurs and then send that information back.
