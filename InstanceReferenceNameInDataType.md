# Instance reference name in data type (class)
* this? self?
  - Java
    * Within an instance method or a constructor, "this" is a reference to the current object â€” the object whose method or constructor is being called. You can refer to any member of the current object from within an instance method or a constructor by using this.
    
    public class Point {  
      public int x = 0;  
      public int y = 0;  
      //constructor  
      public Point(int x, int y) {  
          this.x = x;  
          this.y = y;  
      }  
    }
    
  - C#
    * Much like Java the "this"  is a reference to the current instance of the class and is also used as a modifier of the first parameter of an extension method.
    
    public Employee(string name){  
      this.name = name;  
    }
