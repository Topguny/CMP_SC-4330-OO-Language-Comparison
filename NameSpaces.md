# Name spaces
* How are name spaces implemented?
  - Java
    * Java uses the term packages, when a new project is started it auto generates a package as well for you, Packages hold classes, classes hold code.
    * Essentially used to organize files or types to avoid conflicts.
    * Access can be restricted so that a class can only be acessiable from within its own package.
  - C#
    * C# actually uses the name namespace for its system, its system does pretty well just mirror Javas.
