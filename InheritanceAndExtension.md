# Inheritance / Extension
* Java
  - Inheritance and Extension go hand in hand in Java, as a sub-class can inherit  fields and methods from its superclass. And how you declare a class a sub-class of another class or a superclass is by using the keyword "extends". A key thing to remember is a class in Java only supports single Inheritance and not multiple.
  
  public class Pet{  
  //stuff  
  }
  
  public class Dog extends Pet{ //this is where a dog gets ineheritance from pet by extending from it   
    
  }
