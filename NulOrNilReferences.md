# Null/nil references
* Which does the language use? (null/nil/etc)
  - Java uses null
  
  - C# uses null.
* Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?

  - Java considers null to be nothing particurally special, but it does consider it a string that is handled differently by the compiler also known as a literal. No variables or classes can be named null, but null itself has no special properites and simply refers to a non-existant object.
  
  - C# considers null a keyword and it is simply something that refers to no object. Value or primitave type can not naturally be set to null, but there are special types, created by added a ? to the end, that allows for nulls to be assigned to them.
