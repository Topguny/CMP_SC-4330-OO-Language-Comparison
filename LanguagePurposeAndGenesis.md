  # Language purpose/genesis
  * Why was the language created?
    - Java
      * With the creation of the internet and how wide spread it had come they wanted a language that would enable the creation of applets for the internet. Also the want for a more coplex language, that would handle trivial things for you.
      * What problems was the language trying to address?
        - For one Handling a web application that could do more than just show data like html, but could actually do the work (logic) as well.
        - Making things simpler like garbage collection.
        - Making things more portable.
        - And overall just improve on the languages before it.
      * Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
        - Java itself comes from C/C++, it shares syntax. But They wanted to build apon it and make it easier with things like garbage collection, as well as give it a new architecture style for coding. This is where OOPS comes in thanks to java.
     - C#
