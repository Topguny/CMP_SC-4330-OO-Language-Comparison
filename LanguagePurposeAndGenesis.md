  # Language purpose/genesis
  * Why was the language created?
    - Java
      * With the creation of the internet and how wide spread it had come they wanted a language that would enable the creation of applets for the internet. Also the want for a more coplex language, that would handle trivial things for you.
    - C#
      * Microsoft wanted a language similar to Java, but wanted do some things different than java had.
  * What problems was the language trying to address?
    - Java
        * For one Handling a web application that could do more than just show data like html, but could actually do the work (logic) as well.
        * Making things simpler like garbage collection.
        * Making things more portable.
        * And overall just improve on the languages before it.
    - C#
      * When C# first came out it and java were very similar, almost identical languages. It was not until C# 2.0 that it started to diverge from java. Both added generics around the same time, but C#'s generics can be used like any other class, and code generation is performed at class-load time. The use of LINQ also helped coders cut down on the amount of trivial code, inr order to keep it more readable and maintaniable  
 * Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
   - Java 
      * Java itself comes from C/C++, it shares syntax. But They wanted to build apon it and make it easier with things like garbage collection, as well as give it a new architecture style for coding. This is where OOPS comes in thanks to java.
   - C#
      * C# was Microsofts answer to Java, they wanted their own OOP language that they could do with what they want.
